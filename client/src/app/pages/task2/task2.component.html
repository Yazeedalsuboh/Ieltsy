    <p>
      <strong>IELTS Writing Task 2</strong> is an
      <strong>essay-writing task</strong> where you are required to respond to a
      <strong>point of view, argument, or problem</strong>. Your answer should
      be at least <strong>250 words</strong> and written in a
      <strong>formal style</strong>. You must clearly present your
      <strong>opinion</strong>, support it with
      <strong>relevant examples</strong>, and organize your ideas logically into
      <strong>clear paragraphs</strong>. Focus on demonstrating a strong range
      of <strong>vocabulary and grammar</strong>, maintaining
      <strong>coherence and cohesion</strong>, and answering the question
      <strong>fully and directly</strong>. It’s crucial to manage your time
      well—spend about <strong>40 minutes</strong> on this task as it
      contributes more to your final writing score.
