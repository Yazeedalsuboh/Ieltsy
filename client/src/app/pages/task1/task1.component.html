    <p>
      <strong>IELTS Writing Task 1</strong> requires you to
      <strong>describe, summarize, or explain</strong> information presented in
      a <strong>visual format</strong> such as a graph, chart, table, map, or
      process diagram. Your response should be at least
      <strong>150 words</strong> and written in a <strong>formal style</strong>.
      Focus on presenting <strong>key trends</strong>,
      <strong>comparing data</strong>, and highlighting
      <strong>significant features</strong> without including personal opinions.
      It’s important to <strong>organize ideas clearly</strong>, use a range of
      <strong>vocabulary and grammar</strong> accurately, and avoid copying
      directly from the question. Be mindful of
      <strong>time management</strong>—spend about
      <strong>20 minutes</strong> on this task to ensure enough time for Task 2.
